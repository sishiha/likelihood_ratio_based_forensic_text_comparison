# Likelihood ratio based forensic text comparison system

Two types of likelihood ratio (LR)-based forensic text comparison systems are available. One is based on a deep learning approach and the other is on a machine learning approach. This repository contains the source code used in the paper presented at the 16th Biennial Conference of the International Association for Forensic & Legal Linguistics. The title of the paper is "Estimating Likelihood Ratios for Authorship Evidence with a Deep-learning-based Text Representation".
